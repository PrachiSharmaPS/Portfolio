      <div className="myjourney">
        I started my tech journey after finishing my BCA from IP College Campus
        2 in 2022. Then I got hands-on experience as a backend developer trainee
        at FunstionUp. There, I not only worked on cool projects but also had
        the opportunity to mentor new developers. Since June 2023, I've been
        working as a Web Developer at DronaHQ. It's been an exciting ride,
        creating user-friendly solutions for different businesses.
